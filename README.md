CoreEngine
====================================
This is my first attempt to make a rendering engine, <br />
it is based on Microsoft C++ library **DirectX 11**, <br />
and on **HLSL** as _Shading Language_ <br />

Actually it is able to:
> - load 3D model with extension .obj 
> - load texture  with extension .dds

> - render object with Flat Shading model
> - render object with Gouraud Shading model
> - render object with Phong Shading model
> - render object with texture applied

everything else is work in progress...

(* most updated branch is _develop_)
